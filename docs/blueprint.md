- Background color: Light greenish-grey (#F0F4F3), very desaturated so as not to distract.
- Accent color: Muted blue (#546E7A) for actionable items and important details, complementing the primary color's reliability.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif), modern and readable for clear presentation of financial information.
- Use simple, outlined icons to represent different aspects of the chit plans and application process.
- Clean and structured layout with clear separation of sections to aid comprehension. Prioritize important data (capital, monthly payment) using appropriate visual hierarchy.
- Subtle transitions and loading animations to provide feedback during form submission and data retrieval. Avoid overly distracting animations.
